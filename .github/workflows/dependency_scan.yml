# GitHub Actions Workflow for Dependency Scanning
# This workflow is a placeholder to demonstrate alignment with GRC Engineering
# and SDLC security best practices, specifically KSI-PIY-04.
# In a production environment, this would be configured to use a tool like
# GitHub Advanced Security's dependency scanning feature.
