# FedRAMP GRC-as-Code Continuous Compliance Engine

This project is a demonstration of a "build-first" GRC Engineering approach to achieve continuous assurance and streamline evidence collection for FedRAMP/NIST 800-53 compliance in an AWS environment. It is designed to be an open-source, continuous compliance automation engine focused on a critical configuration management control.

## Project Overview

This engine automates the continuous checking of AWS S3 buckets for compliance with NIST 800-53 CM-6 (Configuration Settings). It is designed for security leaders, GRC practitioners, and cloud engineers in mission-driven environments who value resilience and mission assurance.

The core of the project is an AWS Lambda function that:
- Iterates through all S3 buckets in a specified AWS region.
- Checks each bucket's Public Access Block configuration and default encryption status.
- Generates a machine-readable JSON object (Continuous Compliance Evidence - CCE) for any violations.

This approach shifts GRC left into development practices, enhancing compliance and reducing manual audit findings.

## NIST 800-53 CM-6 Mapping

This project directly addresses the following requirements of NIST 800-53 CM-6:

- **CM-6 (a):** The organization establishes and enforces configuration settings for information technology products and systems.
  - **Implementation:** The Lambda function enforces a baseline configuration for S3 buckets, ensuring that public access is blocked and default encryption is enabled.
- **CM-6 (1):** The organization automates the management of configuration settings.
  - **Implementation:** The entire process is automated, from the deployment of the compliance checker via Terraform to the continuous monitoring of S3 bucket configurations.

## Mission Assurance

This automated compliance engine supports mission assurance by:

- **Reducing the risk of data exposure:** By continuously monitoring for and reporting on misconfigured S3 buckets, the engine helps to prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive data.
- **Ensuring the integrity of data:** By enforcing default encryption, the engine helps to protect data at rest.
- **Providing near real-time visibility into compliance posture:** The CCE generated by the engine provides a continuous stream of evidence that can be used to demonstrate compliance to auditors and stakeholders.
- **Freeing up engineering resources:** By automating a tedious and error-prone manual process, the engine allows engineers to focus on mission-critical tasks.

## Getting Started

1. **Deploy the infrastructure:** Use the provided Terraform script (`main.tf`) to deploy the Lambda function and the required IAM role.
2. **Trigger the Lambda function:** The Lambda function can be triggered manually or by an AWS EventBridge rule for continuous monitoring.
3. **Review the findings:** The Lambda function will output a JSON object for each non-compliant S3 bucket. This output can be ingested by an external GRC platform for further analysis and remediation.
